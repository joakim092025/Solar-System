            <h3>Venus</h3>
            <p>Venus is often called Earth's twin because of its similar size. It has a thick atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, which creates an extreme greenhouse effect. Its surface is hot enough to melt lead.</p>

            <h3>Mars</h3>
            <p>Mars is known as the Red Planet due to the iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It has polar ice caps and signs that liquid water once flowed there. Mars has two small moons: Phobos and Deimos.</p>

            <h3>Uranus</h3>
            <p>Uranus has a pale blue-green color due to methane gas in its atmosphere. It rotates on its side, with an axis nearly horizontal to its orbit. Uranus is extremely cold and has rings as well as at least 27 moons.</p>
